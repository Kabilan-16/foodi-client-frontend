# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# foodi-client-frontend

The frontend is built with React.js, which handles everything that the user sees and interacts with, such as the restaurant listings, menus, and buttons to place an order.
I used Tailwind CSS to make the app look clean and responsive on different devices, so users can easily access it on their phones, tablets, or computers.
The frontend also connects to Firebase for user authentication, allowing users to sign up or log in.
